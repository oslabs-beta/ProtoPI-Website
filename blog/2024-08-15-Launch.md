## ProtoPI Launch - Request for Community Feedback!

We’re exited to introduce ProtoPI, a VS Code extension designed to enhance collaboration between frontend and backend developers. Envision frontend developers building interfaces without waiting on backend APIs and backend developers crafting systems fully aligned with frontend requirements - right from the start. ProtoPI bridges this gap, empowering both sides to work independently while staying fully synchronized.

ProtoPI simplifies the creation and management of OpenAPI Specification files, providing a single source of truth that keeps everyone on the same page.  Our tool ensures that API standards and are followed without slowing down development.

One of the key features of ProtoP is its integrated mock server, which allows frontend teams to work with realistic API responses right from the early stages of development, irrespective of backend progress. This means faster project kick-offs and fewer bottlenecks.

Whether you’re starting a new project or refining an existing one, ProtoPI boosts efficiency and collaboration by address the common challenges in API development. Unlike other tools like Bruno, PostMan, or Insomnia, ProtoPI is designed to revolve around your GitHub repository.  Rather than saving collections in the cloud, everything is stored with the code.  This keeps your API specifications, debugging, and testing all in one place, eliminating the hassle of constantly rebuilding collections.

As we continue to launch ProtoPI, we are seeking community feedback to help shape its future!  We are eager to hear your thoughts on features, improvements, and anything else that could make ProtoPI even more valuable for developers.  This is an open source project, and your input is crucial in guiding its evolution!
