## Example OpenAPI *.YAML/.YML Files

While exploring the provided YAML files—OpenAPI-Collection.yaml, OpenAPI-MultiServer.yaml, and OpenAPI-StarWars.yaml—it's important to note that some of these files may not be fully compatible with the Prism mock server. Here’s a brief overview:

  - **OpenAPI-Collection.yaml [<a href="/yaml/OpenAPI-Collection.yaml" download>DOWNLOAD</a>] [[VIEW](/yaml/OpenAPI-Collection.yaml)]:** This file, with its complex hierarchical structures, is excellent for parsing and understanding how to extract collections from YAML files.

  - **OpenAPI-MultiServer.yaml [<a href="/yaml/OpenAPI-MultiServer.yaml" download>DOWNLOAD</a>] [[VIEW](/yaml/OpenAPI-MultiServer.yaml)]:** A reasonable example of multiple base URLs.

  - **OpenAPI-StarWars.yaml [<a href="/yaml/OpenAPI-StarWars.yaml" download>DOWNLOAD</a>] [[VIEW](/yaml/OpenAPI-StarWars.yaml)]:** A straightforward and simple specification launchable by the PRISM mock server.

Despite these potential issues, these YAML files serve as valuable resources for understanding API specifications and can provide a solid foundation for parsing and studying YAML structures. They offer a practical approach to learning about various API configurations, even if they require some adaptations or additional tools to simulate entirely in a mock environment.
